# Atrium

A Web application for a yoga studio that wishes to manage the classes offered.
Instructors and clients are the main users of this application.

Instructors are capable of creating and updating classes for different locations offered by the studio.
Clients would have the ability to manage the classes they take, and sign up for new ones that become avialable.
